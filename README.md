## ASI-Imaging-Rig
A 3D printable imaging rig for ZWO ASIAir based automated imaging system

### Version 2

This is the development branch for Version 2. None of this is tested yet. I have not yet printed or tested any of these parts yet and it is likely that they need modification. Will try to update as I iterate and test these new parts...
